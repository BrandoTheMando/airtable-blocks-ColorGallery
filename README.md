# Color Gallery 
## A custom block for Airtable

Please visit [Airtable Developers](https://airtable.com/developers) for info on the platform.

This block is part of a larger base template I am building. 
It can be used in several ways, including keeping track of color palettes or displaying a brand's color scheme in a style guide.
 

 To Do:
- [x] Componentization
- [ ] Sorting (so that swatches are always grouped by palette)
- [ ] Table Selection
- [ ] Copy Button(s) for Color Values (or just click text to copy)
- [ ] Palette Sorting (?)
- [ ] Color Conversions (Hex <-> RGB) (?)
- [ ] Color Picker (?)
