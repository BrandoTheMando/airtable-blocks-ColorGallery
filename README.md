# Color Gallery 
## A custom block for Airtable

Please visit [Airtable Developers](https://airtable.com/developers) for info on the platform.

This block is part of a larger base template I am building. 
It can be used in several ways, including keeping track of color palettes or displaying a brand's color scheme in a style guide.
 

 To Do:
- [x] Componentization
- [x] Sorting (so that swatches are always grouped by palette)
- [x] Add Notes as a Tooltip
- [ ] Settings
    - [ ] Table Selection
    - [ ] Field Selections
    - [ ] Hide/Show RGB/HSL
    - [ ] Notes On/Off
    - [ ] Tooltip Opacity (?)
- [ ] Click to Copy Color Values
- [ ] Separated Palette Sections and/or Options for Sorting (?)
- [ ] Color Conversions (Hex <-> RGB) (?)
- [ ] Color Picker (?)
